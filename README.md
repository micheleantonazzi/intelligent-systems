# Introduction

In the last few years, the advances in technologies and research have had an great impact in the development of robotics. The robots are  employed every day in a large variety of contexts. They substitute humans in those activities that can be performed more quickly and precisely. An example is the manufacturing, when the production process is automatized using artificial agents to improve productivity and reduce costs. In this case, the robots are fixed manipulators with a limited range of motions, that depends on where it is bolted down. This characteristic strongly limits agent possibilities. Generally, a fixed robot is programmed to performed a single precise task and it operates in a controlled environments. This means that the algorithm foresees every possible situation and often it is coded as a state machine. In contrast, mobile robots would be able to travel within the environment in which they operate, applying its talents wherever it is most effective. Thank to mobility, the robotics applications become almost limitless. Some of them are healthcare, entertainment and rescue. Mobile robots are also employed in those tasks that are impossible or too dangerous for humans, like exploration of hostile environments: a building on fire, the seabeds or the surface of another planet. The first problem that a mobile robot has to solve is how to move inside the environment. The first aspect is the locomotion system, viewed from a mechanical point of view. Generally it strongly depends on the type of the environment and it seems to be
